// Helmfile is a declarative tool for deploying and managing Helm charts.
// It provides a convenient way to define and manage complex Helm deployments using a YAML-based configuration file.
// Some advantages of using helmfile include:
// - Simplified deployment management: Helmfile allows you to define and manage multiple Helm releases in a single configuration file, making it easier to manage complex deployments.
// - Version control and reproducibility: Helmfile allows you to version control your deployment configurations, making it easier to track changes and reproduce deployments.
// - Dependency management: Helmfile supports dependency management, allowing you to define and manage dependencies between different Helm charts.
// - Environment-specific configurations: Helmfile supports environment-specific configurations, allowing you to define different values for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
// - Templating and parameterization: Helmfile supports templating and parameterization, allowing you to dynamically generate Helm chart configurations based on variables and templates.

// Please note that the advantages mentioned above are general benefits of using helmfile and may vary depending on your specific use case and requirements.
